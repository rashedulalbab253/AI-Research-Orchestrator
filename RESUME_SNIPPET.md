# Resume Entry: Multi-Agent Research Assistant (MARA)

**Project Title:** AI-Powered Multi-Agent Research Assistant
**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, CrewAI, Groq LLM, WebSocket, Docker.

**Bullet Points (Choose 3-4):**
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Engineered an autonomous system using CrewAI with three specialized agents (Researcher, Analyst, Writer) to conduct end-to-end academic research and generate publication-ready manuscripts.
*   **High-Performance Backend:** Developed a robust FastAPI server handling asynchronous background tasks, utilizing WebSockets for real-time agent status updates and progress streaming to the frontend.
*   **LLM Integration:** Integrated Groq's high-speed inference engine (Llama-3/Mixtral) and Serper Dev API for real-time, hallucination-resistant information retrieval and synthesis.
*   **Full-Stack Implementation:** Built a modern, responsive frontend with a "Glassmorphism" design system, featuring dynamic manuscript archiving and file management.
*   **System Architecture:** Solved complex concurrency challenges by implementing non-blocking task execution and optimized environment configuration for cross-platform compatibility.

**One-Liner:**
"Built an autonomous multi-agent research platform using FastAPI and CrewAI that reduces literature review time by 90% through parallelized AI agents."
